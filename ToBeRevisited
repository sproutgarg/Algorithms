ARRAY
bucket sort--> involves insertion sort of link list OR ordered data structure like min/max heap
remove 2 min gt max --> dynamic programming to optimize the solution from expo to quadratic
kth smallest element --> requires heapify ELSE can be implemented via merge algo
median of 2 arrays --> binary search approach went wrong 

Sort n numbers in range from 0 to n^2 – 1 in linear time  --> radix sort + counting sort
suffix array --> from coursera tutorial (better time complexity)
Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix --> dynamic programming to optimize the solution
Rearrange an array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]] with O(1) extra space  --> unable to understand the problem

heap sort

TREE
passing information in N-ARY tree in minimum iteration

LINKED LIST
quick sort on singly and doubly link list

ENHANCEMENTS
countmultiples for given 'N', generalize 

CONCEPTS TO LEARN
heapify DONE
KMP Algorithm to implement subString() or Searching for patterns
DP DOING
Graphs
String Questions DOING
Java Garbage Collector, HashMap implementation
Virtual Memory and Paging
Elastic Search
low level design

PAGE COUNT
array : 2
tree : 2
link list : 1
