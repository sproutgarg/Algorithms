ARRAY
bucket sort--> involves insertion sort of link list OR ordered data structure like min/max heap
remove 2 min gt max --> dynamic programming to optimize the solution from expo to quadratic
kth smallest element --> requires heapify ELSE can be implemented via merge algo
median of 2 arrays --> binary search approach went wrong 

Sort n numbers in range from 0 to n^2 – 1 in linear time  --> radix sort + counting sort
suffix array --> from coursera tutorial (better time complexity)
Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix --> dynamic programming to optimize the solution
Rearrange an array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]] with O(1) extra space  --> unable to understand the problem

heap sort

TREE
passing information in N-ARY tree in minimum iteration

LINKED LIST
quick sort on singly and doubly link list
