/**
 * Concept Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree Serialization is to store
 * tree in a file so that it can be later restored. The structure of tree must
 * be maintained. Deserialization is reading tree back from file.
 * 
 * Following are some simpler versions of the problem:
 * 
 * If given Tree is Binary Search Tree? If the given Binary Tree is Binary
 * Search Tree, we can store it by either storing preorder or postorder
 * traversal. In case of Binary Search Trees, only preorder or postorder
 * traversal is sufficient to store structure information.
 * 
 * If given Binary Tree is Complete Tree? A Binary Tree is complete if all
 * levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and all nodes of
 * last level are as left as possible (Binary Heaps are complete Binary Tree).
 * For a complete Binary Tree, level order traversal is sufficient to store the
 * tree. We know that the first node is root, next two nodes are nodes of next
 * level, next four nodes are nodes of 2nd level and so on.
 * 
 * If given Binary Tree is Full Tree? A full Binary is a Binary Tree where every
 * node has either 0 or 2 children. It is easy to serialize such trees as every
 * internal node has 2 children. We can simply store preorder traversal and
 * store a bit with every node to indicate whether the node is an internal node
 * or a leaf node.
 * 
 * How to store a general Binary Tree? A simple solution is to store both
 * Inorder and Preorder traversals. This solution requires requires space twice
 * the size of Binary Tree. We can save space by storing Preorder traversal and
 * a marker for NULL pointers.
