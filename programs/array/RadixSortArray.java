/**
 * @question Given an array of numbers of size n. It is also given that the
 *           array elements are in range from 0 to n2 – 1. Sort the given array
 *           in linear time.
 * 
 *           Examples: Since there are 5 elements, the elements can be from 0 to
 *           24. Input: arr[] = {0, 23, 14, 12, 9} Output: arr[] = {0, 9, 12,
 *           14, 23}
 * 
 *           Since there are 3 elements, the elements can be from 0 to 8. Input:
 *           arr[] = {7, 0, 2} Output: arr[] = {0, 2, 7}
