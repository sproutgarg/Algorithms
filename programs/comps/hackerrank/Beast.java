Sherlock Holmes is getting paranoid about Professor Moriarty, his archenemy. All his efforts to subdue Moriarty have been in vain. These days Sherlock is working on a problem with Dr. Watson. Watson mentioned that the CIA has been facing weird problems with their supercomputer, �The Beast�, recently.

This afternoon, Sherlock received a note from Moriarty, saying that he has infected �The Beast� with a virus. Moreover, the note had the number N printed on it. After doing some calculations, Sherlock figured out that the key to remove the virus is the largest �Decent� Number having N digits.

A �Decent� Number has -
1. Only 3 and 5 as its digits.
2. Number of times 3 appears is divisible by 5.
3. Number of times 5 appears is divisible by 3.

Meanwhile, the counter to destruction of �The Beast� is running very fast. Can you save �The Beast�, and find the key before Sherlock?

Input Format
The 1st line will contain an integer T, the number of test cases, followed by T lines, each line containing an integer N i.e. the number of digits in the number 

Output Format
Largest Decent number having N digits. If no such number exists, tell Sherlock that he is wrong and print �-1� 

Constraints
1<=T<=20
1<=N<=100000


Sample Input

4
1
3
5
11
Sample Output

-1
555
33333
55555533333
Explanation
For N=1 , there is no such number. 
For N=3, 555 is only possible number.
For N=5, 33333 is only possible number.
For N=11 , 55555533333 and all of permutations of digits are valid numbers, among them, the given number is the largest one.
